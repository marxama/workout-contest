# workout-contest

A website I made for a friend's organization, who wanted a website for registering which days each contestant had done any workout. Made with Clojure, Noir and Hiccup, and some feeble attempts at using jQuery and AJAX. Security, performance and esthetics were never a concern, but I'm still happy with the results (but not as happy as my friend). Some of the contents have naturally been changed to not include personal information.

Made in September 2012.
